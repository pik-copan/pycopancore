# Contributing to pycopancore

Thank you for your interest in contributing to *pycopancore*, the reference implementation of the copan:CORE World-Earth modelling framework.
We currently prefer contributions in the form of bug reports, feature requests,
and suggestions of code improvements as issues in the
[pycopancore GitHub repository](https://github.com/pik-copan/pycopancore/issues).
If you want to contribute code, please follow the instructions below.


## Getting Started

Before you start contributing to *pycopancore*, here are a few steps to get you
set up:

1. Fork the [pycopancore GitHub repository](https://github.com/pik-copan/pycopancore)
to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/pycopancore.git
   cd pycopancore
   ```
3. Install the library and its dependencies:
   ```shell
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

Now you're ready to start making contributions!

## Creating Releases

To create a new release with automatic CITATION.cff updates, use the release script:

```bash
# Install development dependencies (required for release script)
pip install -e .[dev]

# Create a local release (updates CITATION.cff, commits, tags)
./scripts/release.sh 0.8.7

# Push to repository (triggers CI pipeline)
# The script will show the correct branch name to push
git push origin <current-branch> --tags
```

The release script will:
- Update CITATION.cff to the specified version
- Commit the changes
- Format code with black
- Run tests with pytest (fails if tests fail)
- Run linting with flake8 (fails if issues found)
- Create the git tag (only if all checks pass)

**Prerequisites:** Install development dependencies first:
```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

The CI pipeline will then automatically:
- Build the package
- Validate package with twine check
- Test package installation
- Update CITATION.cff (if tag push)
- Upload to PyPI (if tag push)
- Create GitHub release (if tag push)

This ensures that CITATION.cff always reflects the exact version of the release.
