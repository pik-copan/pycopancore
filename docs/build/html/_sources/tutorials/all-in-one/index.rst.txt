All in one tutorial
===================

In this tuturial, we will implement and use a simple toy model from scratch,
learning about most of the essential features of copan\:CORE.

The model we will implement is a version of the copan\:EXPLOIT model described 
in `Wiedermann et al. (2015) 
<https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.91.052801>`_.

Preliminaries:

- You should have experience with Python 3
- You should have a basic understanding of object-oriented programming 
  (classes vs. objects, methods vs. functions, ...)
