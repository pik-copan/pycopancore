Entity-type "Group"
===================

For many model components, especially those involving cultural, 
micro-economic, or other social processes,
the metabolic/economic/political/administrative partitioning of the global social metabolism 
into what we call :doc:`"social systems"<social system>` 
(nation states, regions, urban areas, ...)
may not be sufficient and a distinction of social strata or other social groups or parties 
(e.g., "European working class", "global elite", "scientists", "climate activists", 
"indigenous people", "social democrats", a certain NGO, ...)
that is transverse to the former partitioning is helpful in addition.

For this, the entity-type "group" is provided
which is meant to represent any grouping of individuals (that may come from one or several social systems) 
by meaningful cultural or social-metabolic aspects.

In contrast to a :doc:`social system<social system>`, 
a group does *not* normally have a territory and does not even have to be otherwise localised, 
and does *not* normally have a high degree of social-metabolic integration and independence from other groups.

While social systems cannot have non-trivial intersections (they can only be disjoint or containing each other completely),
groups may *overlap* in any complex ways.

Wikipedia has a nice **working definition** of what makes a group: 
"a group is defined in terms of those who identify themselves as members of the group".

Groups may act as agents in agent-based model components.


Basic relationships to other entity-types
-----------------------------------------

A group will usually...

-  have several members :doc:`individuals<individual>`,
   which is represented by a group membership directed network owned by the culture taxon

In addition, a group may...

-  have an "intra" group network between members :doc:`individuals<individual>`

-  have one or several "leader" :doc:`individuals<individual>`,
   of which one may be the dominant leader

-  have a "headquarters" :doc:`cell<cell>`

-  be related to other groups via an "inter" network owned by the culture taxon
   (which will typically interact with the network of personal acquaintance between member individuals)

-  act as the current "elite" in some :doc:`social system<social system>`

All these relationships may be dynamic.

Finally, a group may...

-  be a permanent subgroup of a larger group or :doc:`social system<social system>` *by definition* 
   (rather than by coincidence, e.g., "scientists" are by definition a subgroup of the group "academics",
   and "German workers" may be by definition a subgroup of the social system "Germany")
