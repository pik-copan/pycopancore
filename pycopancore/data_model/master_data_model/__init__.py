# Dimension and Unit objects are defined at attributes in 
# dimensions_and_units.DimensionsAndUnits so that sphinx will document them.
# The following makes them accessible as package attributes:
from .dimensions_and_units import *
for k, o in DimensionsAndUnits.__dict__.items():
    if isinstance(o, (Dimension, Unit)):
        globals()[k] = o
